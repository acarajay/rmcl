README

Last updated: May 26, 2015

This README serves as the main documentation for this work. "Sub-README"s can be found in some of the folders in this work. These "sub-README"s just echo what is mentioned in this documentation for super awesomeness documentation purposes (and also to give a push in the right direction if anyone gets lost)

Quick start/TL;DR Section (for you impatient ones :D )

===================================================================================


1) To compile the needed files for running MLR-CAw, run Make.

2) Make will also compile the needed files for F-Scoring in the scoring folder.

3) To cluster a file using MLR-CAw, run the shell script "mlrcaw.sh". Command-line arguments are:
		1) input file: name of the input file of the PPIN dataset
			-- We included copies of the datasets we used (the "biogrid" and "dip" files in the graphs folder)
		2) threshold: threshold value to use for FS-weighting
		3) alpha: alpha value to use in CAw scheme
		4) gamma: gamma value to use in CAw scheme
	
	-- The default filename of the clustering output is "<name of input file>pt<thresholdvalue>a<alphavalue>g<gammavalue>"
		ex. If the PPIN dataset is a file named "proteins", and mlrcaw was run with threshold = 0.2, alpha = 1.0, gamma = 3.0, 
		the clustering output will be a file named "proteinspt0.2a1.0g3.0"
	-- For more on this, see Part II on the Naming Conventions. 
	-- This file will be saved in the "scoring" folder

	-- If there is a problem with running the MLRMCL portion of the script, check to see that you have the appropriate MLRMCL version placed in the "bin" directory (see Part I , at the MLRMCL for more details)

4) To score the output of MLR-CAw for BioGRID or DIP datasets (F-score under 4 scenarios), run the shell script "fourscenarios.sh" in the folder "scoring". Command-line arguments of "fourscenarios.sh" are:
	1) b or d: if the cluster result you will want to score is biogrid or dip
	2) filename of clustering output

	Ex. ./fourscenarios.sh b proteinspt0.2a1.0g3.0

5) To score the output of MLR-CAw under your own scenarios, or to score using other literature (not BioGRID or DIP), you can independently run FScoring or FScoringInc. FScoring however excludeds NAN clusters from the average F-score, while FScoringInc includes them. (See FScoring Package for more details)


====================================================================================

I. The Components of MLR-CAw 

====================================================================================

MLR-CAw is composed of the following components: 

A. FSWeighting
	--This adds the weighting to an input graph. Run this before the actual mlrmcl.
	--Threshold: default is 0.2
	
	--INPUT: the uncleaned network file
		--sample input to this is biogrid.in
	--OUTPUT: this will give 2 files:
		1) a resulting network file with weights (usually named with "t<somevalue>" at the end, see Part II Naming Conventions)
			-- this output file will be saved in the folder "thresholdfiles" at the end of the MLR-CAw run
		2) another network file formatted for MLRMCL (usually named with "mt<somevalue>" at the end, see Part II Naming Conventions)
			-- this output file will be saved in the folder "clustering" at the end of the MLR-CAw run


B. MLRMCL
	-- For running MLR-CAw, it's enough to be able to run the .exe of the MLRMCL method. 
	-- We have provided two versions of the .exe of the MLRMCL: one compiled under a 32-bit system (found in the folder "mlrmcl-32" folder), and one compiled under a 64-bit system (found in the folder "mlrmcl-64").
	-- Please copy+paste the appropriate version to the "bin" folder, since this is where the script (mlrcaw.sh) will look for it. 
	-- We have NOT provided the .cpp file! If you want to rebuild/recompile mlrmcl, it needs libraries in the 3.package folder. Check out the documentations there to recompile it. 
	--The 3.package folder was kindly provided for by Satuluri et. al. 
	
	--INPUT: the output file #2 from FSWeighting (usually named with "mt<somevalue>" at the end, see Part II Naming Conventions)
	--OUTPUT: a file where each line indicates the cluster number that the nth line/protein belongs to (usually named with "ct<somevalue>" at the end, see Part II Naming Conventions)
		-- this output file will be saved in the folder "clustering" at the end of the MLR-CAw run


C. CAw
	--Run this with the formatted output of MLRMCL
	--Alpha: default is 1.0
	--Gamma: default is 0.75

	--INPUTS: 
		1) the network file with weights (output file #1 from FSWeighting)
		2) the clustering file resulting from MLRMCL
	--OUTPUT: a file where each line corresponds to a cluster number. On each line is a list of the proteins that belong to this cluster. Proteins are indicated with a number/id based on the mapping files (BioGRID_AGaser_graph_mapping, and DIP_AGaser_graph_mapping for BioGRID and DIP datasets respectively)
		-- this file can be found in the folder "scoring" at the end of the MLR-CAw run 


====================================================================================

II. MLR-CAw File Outputs Naming Conventions

====================================================================================

Each file begins with a "b" or a "d", depending if the clustering was on BioGRID or DIP.

t indicates a threshold value (for FSWeighting) immediately after it
a indicates an alpha value (for CAw) immediately after it
g indicates a gamma value (for CAw) immediately after it 


Example:
One run of clustering the BioGRID file will result in the ff. files:
	bt<value> : the resulting network file with weights (output of FSWeighting)
	bmt<value> : the network file formatted for MLRMCL. This is also an "output" of FSWeighting and is used as input to MLRMCL
	bct<value>: the clusterings resulting from MLRMCL. This is the output file of MLRMCL
	bpt<value>a<value>g<value>: the result from CAw with threshold, alpha, and gamma values indicated.
	bsct<value>a<value>g<value>: the CAw result with computed FScores and matched clusters


====================================================================================

III. Scoring Package

====================================================================================

A. Four Scenarios
--To do four scenarios, run the script "fourscenarios.sh" found in the scoring folder
--This calculates the FScore under four scenarios:
	
	Scenario A: Include NAN clusters in calculation, Use a tailored version of CYC (eliminates proteins not in biogrid/dip from CYC)

	Scenario B: Exclude NAN clusters in calculation, Use a tailored version of CYC
	
	Scenario C: Include NAN clusters in calculation, Use complete CYC

	Scenario D: Exclude NAN clusters in calculation, Use complete CYC

--"fourscenarios.sh" runs FScoring and FScoringInc:

	--FScoring gets the maximum FScore of each cluster resulting from CAw, and gives the average FScore at the end, EXCLUDING NAN CLUSTERS
	--FSCoringInc does the same, except it INCLUDES NAN CLUSTERS
	--Both can be called individually outside the shell script if you want to define your own scenarios or indicate specific files
	--Inputs to both are: 
		1) the output file from MLRCAw
		2) the mapping of the proteins to their ids (BioGRID_AGAser_graph_mapping)
		3) the version of CYC you want to use (or basically any listing of complexes and their proteins based on experimental data)

====================================================================================

IV. Scoring Results Related to Thesis Manuscript

====================================================================================

In the scoring folder, there are also folders containing the results (raw output and scored results) of the various methods we ran over the two datasets we used in this work. 

The raw output files give the list of the predicted complexes resulting from running a method. Each line corresponds to one predicted complex. Numbers on each line are the protein IDs, as based on the mapping files provided (BioGRID_AGAser_graph_mapping and DIP_AGaser_graph_mapping)


The scored results give the list of predicted complexes as based on the raw output file, but with their associated complex name as based on the maximal F-score mapped to the complex (see the thesis manuscript for more details). The maximal F-score is also given per line. The last line gives the average F-score of the clustering result.  


For further details, see the README file within the scoring folder.

V. Tuning Parameter Values Scripts

====================================================================================

In the varyingparameters folder are the .cpp and script files we used for testing the best parameter values for threshold, alpha, and gamma values, as discussed in the manuscript of our thesis.

In the same folder, we also placed a folder named "results". This folder contains all the raw output and scored output files of each run of the hybrid algorithm done in order to tune the parameters to their best values. The files are numerous, but we just included them for completeness' sake, in case anyone wants to see the nitty-gritty numbers involved in varying the parameters of each run :) 

A. scenarioalgac.sh
	--This script varies the value of alpha OR gamma given a particular threshold. 
		--Alpha is varied from 1 to 20 with a stepsize of 0.5 (results in 39 files)
		--Gamma is varied from 0.05 to 5 with a stepsize of 0.05 (results in 100 files)
	--Note that this script needs all the files of the MLR-CAw (ie, FSWeight, mlrmcl, CAw)
	--It does not make use of the mlrcaw.sh script; hence, to use it, you need to make sure that copies of the 3 .exe files mentioned (FSWeight, mlrmcl, CAw) exist in the same directory. 
	--This script also scores all outputs resulting from varying the alpha or gamma parameter using the FScoringParams and FScoringIncParams (source files of the two can be found in the src folder). For more details on how these files score the output results differently, see Section B.  
	
	--INPUTS:
		1) b or d: if the dataset to use is BioGRID or DIP
		2) a or g: specify a, if you want to vary alpha, or g if you want to vary gamma
		3) threshold value: the threshold value to use while varying one parameter.
		4) other value: the value to use for the other parameter not being varied ( this will be gamma if you're varying alpha, alpha if you're varying gamma)

	--OUTPUTS:
		1) Scored files of all 4 scenarios for each MLR-CAw run (ie, for all parameter "tuples"). Scored files will be placed in the folder "outputs"
		2) Raw output files of each MLR-CAw run. Raw output files are placed in the folder "rawoutputs"


B. FScoringParams and FScoringIncParams
	--These are scoring executable files tailored specifically for varying parameter values. 
	--These executable files write all tuples (average F-score, average precision, average recall, geometric mean, and number of output complexes) to only one file for convenience. The name of the output file is the same as the original FScoring files (ie, appends "scenarioA", "scenarioB", "scenarioC", or "scenarioD" to the name of the file to be scored)
		--The output file has 8 columns:
	Threshold Value | Alpha Value | Gamma Value | Average F-score | Average Precision | Average Recall | Geometric Mean | Number of Output Clusters
		--Basically, each line gives the average F-score, average precision, average recall, geometric mean, and number of output clusters corresponding to each tuple of paramter values.
