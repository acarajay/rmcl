README (Documentation for this folder)

This folder contains the files needed in the scoring package we used to score the results of clustering methods.

To score a clustering result with the BioGRID or DIP dataset, you may use the "fourscenarios.sh" script. This script can only be used for scoring results from clustering BioGRID and DIP datasets. To score results from clustering other datasets, run FScoring or FScoringInc separately on these results (see the README in the root folder for more details).

The Makefile in this folder is used to compile FScoring and FScoringInc.
