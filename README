All input files are in the folder "inputfiles"


FSWeighting
--this adds the weighting to an input graph. Run this before the actual mlrmcl.
--sample input to this is biogrid2.in
--threshold: So far, we've used 0.2


MLRMCL
--the .exe is provided, not the .cpp file! (if you want to rebuild/recompile mlrmcl, it needs libraries not yet included in this repo).
--it's enough to be able to run the .exe :) I think :)
--run this with the output file of the FSWeighting as its input
--this will give a file, where each line indicates the cluster number that the nth line/protein 
belongs to


CAw
--run this with the formatted output of MLRMCL
--sample inputs to this are biogrid0.2 (output of FSWeighting), biogrid0.2clustering (output of MLRMCL)
--this will give a file, each line corresponds to a cluster number. On each line is a list of the proteins that 
belong to this cluster. Proteins are indicated with a number/id based on the file BioGRID_AGaser_graph_mapping


FScoring
--gets the maximum Fscore of each cluster resulting from CAw, and gives the average FScore at the end
--still not so optimized (still a little slow)
--sample inputs to this are CAw_output_0.2, BioGRID_AGaser_graph_mapping, clusters_with_proteins_list
(there are 3 input files needed: one is the output from CAw, second is the mapping of proteins to the ids, third is the listing of complexes and their proteins based on experimental data)
