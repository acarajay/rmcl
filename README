**To run a batch of clustering with varying threshold values in FS Weighting, run the script "threshold.sh"

**To run a batch of clustering with varying alpha or gamma parameters in Core-Attachment, run the script "alphagamma.sh"

**These will only run properly if:
	--there is a folder named "mlr_and_mlroutputs" in the root directory, and the mlrmcl .exe is located there
	--there is a folder named "predicted" in the root directory, and the FScoring is compiled there

**The Makefiles still need to be edited so that they will be consistent with the bash scripts. THEY HAVE NOT YET BEEN UPDATED AS OF NOW. 


FSWeighting
--this adds the weighting to an input graph. Run this before the actual mlrmcl.
--sample input to this is biogrid.in
--threshold: default is 0.2



MLRMCL
--the .exe is provided, not the .cpp file! (if you want to rebuild/recompile mlrmcl, it needs libraries not yet included in this repo).
--it's enough to be able to run the .exe :) I think :)
--run this with the output file of the FSWeighting as its input
--this will give a file, where each line indicates the cluster number that the nth line/protein belongs to


CAw
--run this with the formatted output of MLRMCL
--sample inputs to this are biogrid0.2 (output of FSWeighting), biogrid0.2clustering (output of MLRMCL)
--this will give a file, each line corresponds to a cluster number. On each line is a list of the proteins that 
belong to this cluster. Proteins are indicated with a number/id based on the file BioGRID_AGaser_graph_mapping


FScoring
--gets the maximum Fscore of each cluster resulting from CAw, and gives the average FScore at the end
--still not so optimized (still a little slow)
--sample inputs to this are CAw_output_0.2, BioGRID_AGaser_graph_mapping, clusters_with_proteins_list
(there are 3 input files needed: one is the output from CAw, second is the mapping of proteins to the ids, third is the listing of complexes and their proteins based on experimental data)


Naming conventions:

Each file begins with a "b" or a "d", depending if the clustering was on BioGRID or DIP.

t indicates a threshold value (for FSWeighting) immediately after it
a indicates an alpha value (for CAw) immediately after it
g indicates a gamma value (for CAw) immediately after it 


Example-- One run of clustering the BioGRID file will result in the ff. files:
bt<value> : the resulting network file with weights (output of FSWeighting)
bmt<value> : the network file formatted for MLRMCL. This is also an "output" of FSWeighting and is used as input to MLRMCL
bct<value>: the clusterings resulting from MLRMCL. This is the output file of MLRMCL
bpt<value>a<value>g<value>: the result from CAw with threshold, alpha, and gamma values indicated.
bsct<value>a<value>g<value>: the CAw result with computed FScores and matched clusters


Formatting for Cytoscape/Gephi:
--To convert the CAw result to a format readable by Cytoscape/Gephi, run CytoConverter (this is still raw)
--Naming convention used here is the same, except resulting file begins w/ "v" (visualization)
